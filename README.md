The user can change book's shelf by clicking on the â†“ button and selecting one of the shelfs. If **None** is selected, the book will be removed from the shelfs.

To search for a book, click the + button on the bottom right of the page.

The user can search for a book's title or author. It will be displayed up to 20 results. 

The application uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md).
